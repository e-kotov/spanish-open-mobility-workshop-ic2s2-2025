### If you are using our pre-converted data from SSD

If you are using the files copied from the SSD passed around during the workshop (kindly, remember to return it), you can instead use `spod_connect()` function to load the pre-converted data in `DuckDB` format that is optimized for speed. In this case you will be able to quickly analyze multiple dates available in respective folders of the SSD. Open the `*.Rproj` file in the root of the folder you copied and see some starter code in `start-here.R` to point the `spod_connect()` towards a `*.duckdb` file.

| Folder                          | Dates                         |
