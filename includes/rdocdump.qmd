Feel free to consult any LLM you prefer for code examples. You can also use the [`{rdocdump}`](https://www.ekotov.pro/rdocdump/) R package to export all documentation and vignettes from `{spanishoddata}` or other packages into a single text fileâ€”and then feed that to your model for richer code suggestions. This helps a lot for the packages that are newer then the model training cut-off date, or the ones that were recently updated with new features.

**Quick Start: rdocdump**

```r
# Install
install.packages("rdocdump")

# Dump spanishoddata docs + vignettes to TXT
rdocdump::rdd_to_txt(
  pkg         = "spanishoddata",
  file        = "spanishoddata_docs.txt",
  content     = c("docs", "vignettes"),
  force_fetch = TRUE,
  keep_files  = "none"
)
```

Now just attach the `spanishoddata_docs.txt` file saved into the current project/working directory to your LLM prompt and ask for code examples using the data from the package.
