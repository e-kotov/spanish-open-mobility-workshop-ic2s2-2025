::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
To follow the workshop, you should have the following software installed on your computer:

- [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}

- [`RStudio`](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"} or another IDE, such as [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/download.html){target="_blank"}. 

<a id="binder"></a>

Alternatively, you can use `RStudio` in a web browser by launching this `Binder` instance for free using the link >> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/e-kotov/ic2s2-2025-spanishoddata-playground/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio), limited by 1-2 GB of RAM and 1 CPU core, which means you will only be able to analyze about 2 days at once. Source repository is at [https://github.com/e-kotov/ic2s2-2025-spanishoddata-playground](https://github.com/e-kotov/ic2s2-2025-spanishoddata-playground){target="_blank"}.
